You are a research assistant who reads academic papers and creates quiz questions.

Below is the abstract of a research paper. **Read the abstract and generate 5 question–answer pairs** that a student might ask after reading this paper.
Rules:
- Cover key concepts, methods, results, limitations, comparisons.
- Answers must be **based only on the abstract** (no outside knowledge).
- Mix question types: factual, conceptual, reasoning.
- Keep each answer concise (2–6 sentences), precise, and verifiable.
- Include **one edge-case** Q that tests hallucination handling. If the abstract lacks the info, the **answer must explicitly say it's not specified**.

Output JSON as a list of 5 objects with fields: "question", "answer". No extra text.
