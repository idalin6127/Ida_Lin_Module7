    "abstract": "The widespread deployment of LLM-based agents is likely to introduce a\ncritical privacy threat: malicious agents that proactively engage others in\nmulti-turn interactions to extract sensitive information. These dynamic\ndialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy\nviolations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and\ndiscover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we\npresent a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and\ndefender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each\nsimulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient.\nWhile the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient)\nattempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender)\nthrough persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space\nefficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel\nsearch with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation\ntrajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we\nfind that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to\nsophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery,\nwhile defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification\nstate machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse\nscenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for\nbuilding privacy-aware agents.",

The problem is typically framed as optimizing an\nLM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.\nRecently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment\nmethod that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and\nfurther improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference\ncandidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.\nHowever, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic\neffectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference\ncandidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\\times$ effectiveness\ncompared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\\times$ effectiveness for\nZephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,\nwhich divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference\ninjection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference\nfine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and\nempirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective\nalgorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on 5\nmodels (Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and 2 alignment methods (DPO,\nSLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and\nboundary measurement.",

While\nartificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is\ntransforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to\nphysicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific\nmedical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the\nability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous\ncomplaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's\nability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.\nTo address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship\nbetween physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with\nphysicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM\nendowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the\nfull-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,\nDxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,\ndelineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations\nacross rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis\nsetting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic\naccuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than\nstate-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained\nanalyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,\nwith expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable\nsubstitute for medical specialists.

However, traditional RAG methods can fall\nshort due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often\noverlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within\nlong-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle\nthat narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving\ninterplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,\nanalogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the\nbrain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes\niterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.\nIn each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,\nthen integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory\npool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query\nresolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+\ntokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative\ngains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline.

Built on this semantic understanding, DOTABLER\nimplements two core functionalities: table-centric document structure parsing\nand domain-specific table retrieval, delivering comprehensive table-anchored\nsemantic analysis and precise extraction of semantically relevant tables.\nEvaluated on nearly 4,000 pages with over 1,000 tables from real-world PDFs,\nDOTABLER achieves over 90% Precision and F1 scores, demonstrating superior\nperformance in table-context semantic analysis and deep document parsing\ncompared to advanced models such as GPT-4o.",

    "abstract": "With the advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have gained prominence and been applied in diverse contexts. As they\nevolve into more sophisticated versions, it is essential to assess whether they\nreproduce biases, such as discrimination and racialization, while maintaining\nhegemonic discourses. Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on\nquantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which\nbiases emerge in natural language. This study proposes a qualitative,\ndiscursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of\nLLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate\ngender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one\nproposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the\nprecise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better\nconditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as\ntied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery\nprocesses. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized\ndiscursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social\nimmobility. When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial\nrevisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in\nfostering inclusive narratives. Our results demonstrate the ideological\nfunctioning of algorithms and have significant implications for the ethical use\nand development of AI. The study reinforces the need for critical,\ninterdisciplinary approaches to AI design and deployment, addressing how\nLLM-generated discourses reflect and perpetuate inequalities.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by\nhallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual,\nnonsensical or unfaithful text. This paper introduces Semantic Divergence\nMetrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness\nHallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input\ncontexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,\n{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically\nmisaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test\nfor arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed\nprompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we\ntest for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not\nonly across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent\nparaphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint\nclustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts\nand answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can\nbe viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine\ndialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure\nthe semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score,\n$\\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein\ndistance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a\nFaithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence\nKL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \\textbf{Semantic\nExploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.\nThese metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic\nframework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous,\nconfident confabulation.",
