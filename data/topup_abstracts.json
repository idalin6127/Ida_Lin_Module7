    "abstract": "Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D\nhuman pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video\npose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.\nIn this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering\nframework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient\ntransformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with\nprogressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering\nfull-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate\ntransformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two\nkey modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module\n(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the\nredundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal\ninformation based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output\nto the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method\nis general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on\nboth seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different\ntoken pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that\nmaintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of\nrepresentative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the\neffectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

Classical\nmotion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full\nenvironment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural\nmotion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop\ndirectly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or\ndynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural\nmotion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic\nenvironments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is\nIMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million\ngenerated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further\nimprove IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher\nfinetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at\ninference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We\nevaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving\nobstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization,\noutperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both\nsimulated and real-world settings.

Motivated by\nrecent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning\ncan further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving\nReasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based\nthinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to\nguide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained\ndetails, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train\nIRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),\nwhich targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate\nstage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality\ntextual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a\nsubsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed\nlearning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full\nthinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that\nnatively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first\nbuilds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline\nin the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA\nperformance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,\nGenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality\nand fine-grained fidelity.

To address\nthe limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that\npredefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time\nsteps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are\ninterpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids\nover-optimization in late timesteps.

This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in\nresponse to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the\nreliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX.1.dev model\nwith optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its\nhuman-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for improving\nthe reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Outcome-based RL,\nwhich rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields\nsubstantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation\ndiversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is\ncritical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL\npost-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce\neffective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our\nstudy highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation,\nwhere reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and\n(ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a\nlimited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose\noutcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final\noutcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,\nwhich encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch\nexploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time\ndiversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models\ndemonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity\ncollapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based\nexploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits.

The occasional volatility in their behavior, such as the propensity\nof transformer models to hallucinate, impedes trust and adoption of emerging AI\nsolutions in high-stakes areas. In the present work, we establish how and when\nhallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept\nrepresentations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with\nexperimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic\nexperiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer\nmodel grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured. In the\nface of growing uncertainty in the input space, the transformer model becomes\nprone to activate coherent yet input-insensitive semantic features, leading to\nhallucinated output. At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide\nvariety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate\nactivations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we\nconfirm through targeted steering. We also show that hallucinations in the\noutput of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept\npatterns embedded in transformer layer activations.

Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial\neffort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own\nwork, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this\nchallenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a\nknowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the\nassociated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol\n(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify\nthe resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat\nagent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through\nnatural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We\ndemonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper\nagents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that\nleverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy\nand TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We\nvalidate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and\ncan correctly carry out novel user queries.

Unlike deep learning (DL)\napproaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach\nalso avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more\nlightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with\nsupervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully\nCSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with\nadjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature\nselection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to\njointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed GL approach achieves competitive spectral\nefficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models, while reducing floating-point\noperations (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude.

Recent research into the internal mechanisms of\nLLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,\nwhich plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior.
